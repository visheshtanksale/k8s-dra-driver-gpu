Feature gates control experimental and beta functionality in the DRA Driver for NVIDIA GPUs. They follow [Kubernetes feature gate conventions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/).

## Set feature gates

Set feature gates in your Helm values file:

```yaml
featureGates:
  TimeSlicingSettings: true
  MPSSupport: true
```

Or pass them at install time:

```bash
helm install dra-driver-nvidia-gpu oci://registry.k8s.io/dra-driver-nvidia/charts/dra-driver-nvidia-gpu \
    --version {{< param "driver_version" >}} \
    --namespace dra-driver-nvidia-gpu \
    --set "featureGates.TimeSlicingSettings=true"
```

## Available feature gates

The Kubernetes column identifies additional Kubernetes version or Kubernetes feature gate requirements beyond the baseline versions in [Prerequisites](../prerequisites.md).

| Feature gate | Stage | Default | Kubernetes | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `TimeSlicingSettings` | Alpha | `false` | No requirements. | Enables customization of CUDA time-slicing settings in `GpuConfig`. |
| `MPSSupport` | Alpha | `false` | No requirements. | Enables Multi-Process Service (MPS) sharing strategy in `GpuConfig` and `MigDeviceConfig`. |
| `IMEXDaemonsWithDNSNames` | Beta | `true` | No requirements. | IMEX daemons use DNS names instead of raw IP addresses for peer communication. Required by `ComputeDomainCliques`. |
| `PassthroughSupport` | Alpha | `false` | No requirements. | Enables VFIO passthrough device allocation using `VfioDeviceConfig`. |
| `DynamicMIG` | Alpha | `false` | v1.34 through v1.35 requires `DRAPartitionableDevices=true` on the kube-apiserver and kube-scheduler.  v1.36 and later enables `DRAPartitionableDevices` by default. See [Kubernetes feature gates](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/#DRAPartitionableDevices). | Enables dynamic MIG device allocation and reconfiguration. See [MIG](../guides/gpu-allocation/mig.md). |
| `NVMLDeviceHealthCheck` | Alpha | `false` | No requirements. | Enables GPU health checking using NVML. |
| `ComputeDomainCliques` | Beta | `true` | No requirements. | Uses `ComputeDomainClique` CRD objects to track IMEX daemon membership. Requires `IMEXDaemonsWithDNSNames`. |
| `CrashOnNVLinkFabricErrors` | Beta | `true` | No requirements. | Causes the kubelet plugin to crash rather than fall back to non-fabric mode when NVLink fabric errors are detected. |
| `DeviceMetadata` | Alpha | `false` | No requirements. | Enables IOMMU API device exposure, such as `/dev/iommu` or `/dev/vfio/vfio`, for VFIO workloads with `VfioDeviceConfig`. Requires `PassthroughSupport`. |
| `FabricManagerPartitioning` | Alpha | `false` | No requirements. | Enables Fabric Manager partition discovery and lifecycle management for full GPUs and VFIO devices on supported HGX and single-node NVL systems. VFIO devices require `PassthroughSupport`. Requires Fabric Manager with `FABRIC_MODE=1`. Each full-GPU or VFIO claim on a participating node must exactly match one published partition. See [Fabric Manager partitioning](../guides/gpu-allocation/fabric-manager-partitioning.md). |
| `HostManagedIMEXDaemon` | Alpha | `false` | No requirements. | Allows `resources.computeDomains.imex.mode=hostManaged`, where you manage the host `nvidia-imex` service instead of the DRA Driver creating per-ComputeDomain daemon DaemonSets. This gate only unlocks the mode. Driver-managed DNS daemon naming and `ComputeDomainClique` tracking are not used in this mode. See [Validate host-managed IMEX](../guides/compute-domain-workloads.md#validate-host-managed-imex). |
| `DRAListTypeAttributes` | Alpha | `false` | v1.36 or later with `DRAListTypeAttributes=true` on the kube-apiserver and kube-scheduler. | Publishes list-valued DRA device attributes, including `resource.kubernetes.io/numaNode` as a one-element list. See [NUMA locality](resourceslice-attributes.md#numa-locality). |
| `ConsumableShares` | Alpha | `false` | v1.34 through v1.35 requires `DRAConsumableCapacity=true` on the kube-apiserver, kube-controller-manager, kube-scheduler, and kubelet; v1.36 and later enables `DRAConsumableCapacity` by default; see [Kubernetes consumable capacity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/dynamic-resource-allocation/#consumable-capacity). | Implements Kubernetes DRA consumable capacity for full GPUs and MIG devices by publishing them as multi-allocatable and defining their capacity request policies; also set the [`consumableShares`](helm-values.md#feature-gates) Helm value to select an accounting mode; see [Consumable capacity](../guides/gpu-allocation/consumable-capacity.md). |
| `VGPUSupport` | Alpha | `false` | v1.34 through v1.35 requires `DRAPartitionableDevices=true` on the kube-apiserver and kube-scheduler; v1.36 and later enables `DRAPartitionableDevices` by default. Requires the NVIDIA vGPU Manager on the host. | Advertises NVIDIA vGPU partition devices (`type=vgpu`, DeviceClass `vgpu.gpu.nvidia.com`) in ResourceSlices as partitionable devices (KEP 4815), one slot device per allowlisted profile. Profiles are selected with the [`vgpu.profiles`](helm-values.md#feature-gates) Helm value. Currently only advertisement is implemented; vGPU claims fail at Prepare time. See the vGPU support design document in the repository (`docs/design/vgpu-support.md`). |
| `DRADeviceCompatibilityGroups` | Alpha | `false` | Requires `DRADeviceCompatibilityGroups=true` on the kube-apiserver and kube-scheduler. | Publishes KEP 5963 `compatibilityGroups` on device `consumesCounters` entries so the scheduler rejects incompatible co-allocations on one physical GPU (vGPU profile families against each other, MIG against vGPU, partitions against full GPUs). Only enable this when the cluster gate of the same name is on; otherwise the scheduler ignores devices that declare groups. |

## Constraints

The following feature gate combinations are mutually exclusive and cannot be enabled together.

| Combination | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| `DynamicMIG` + `PassthroughSupport` | Mutually exclusive |
| `DynamicMIG` + `MPSSupport` | Mutually exclusive |
| `PassthroughSupport` + `NVMLDeviceHealthCheck` | Mutually exclusive |
| `VGPUSupport` + `DynamicMIG` | Mutually exclusive until MIG-backed vGPU partitions share a unified per-GPU CounterSet |
| `VGPUSupport` + `PassthroughSupport` | Mutually exclusive until VFIO devices are representable in the partitionable-devices publish path |

The feature gates below have the following dependencies:

| Feature gate | Requires |
| --- | --- |
| `ComputeDomainCliques` | `IMEXDaemonsWithDNSNames` |
| `DeviceMetadata` | `PassthroughSupport` |
