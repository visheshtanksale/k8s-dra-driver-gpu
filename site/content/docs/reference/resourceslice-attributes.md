description: NVIDIA GPU, MIG, and VFIO device attributes and capacity published by the DRA Driver for NVIDIA GPUs in ResourceSlices.
---

The DRA Driver for NVIDIA GPUs publishes each allocatable device — full GPUs, MIG
slices, and VFIO passthrough devices — as an entry under `spec.devices` in a
node's `ResourceSlice`. This page is a reference for the NVIDIA-specific
attributes and capacity on those entries: what each field means and the exact
names you reference in CEL selectors.

For the generic `ResourceSlice` type schema — every field on `ResourceSlice`,
`Device`, `DeviceAttribute`, `DeviceCapacity`, and related types — see the
[Kubernetes API reference for ResourceSlice v1](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/resource/resource-slice-v1/).
For how the driver publishes slices, see
[Publishing GPUs in ResourceSlices](../concepts/gpu-allocation.md#publishing-gpus-in-resourceslices).
To inspect the ResourceSlices on your own cluster, see
[View available GPU resources](../guides/gpu-allocation/view-resources.md).

## Device types

The DRA Driver for NVIDIA GPUs publishes all devices under a single driver,
`gpu.nvidia.com`, with one pool per node. The NVIDIA-specific `type` attribute on
each device identifies the kind of device, and the built-in DeviceClasses select
on it:

| `type` | DeviceClass | Device |
|---|---|---|
| `gpu` | `gpu.nvidia.com` | Full physical GPU |
| `mig` | `mig.nvidia.com` | MIG slice |
| `vfio` | `vfio.gpu.nvidia.com` | VFIO passthrough device |
| `vgpu` | `vgpu.gpu.nvidia.com` | vGPU partition (abstract; created at Prepare time), requires the `VGPUSupport` feature gate |

The sections below show a representative `spec.devices[]` entry for each type.
`kubectl` prints map keys alphabetically (so `type` and `uuid` appear last), the
`#` comments are annotations rather than part of the real output, and the values
are illustrative — confirm them on your own cluster.

## vGPU partition (type: vgpu)

> **Note:** vGPU support is alpha and requires the `VGPUSupport` feature
> gate, cluster-side `DRAPartitionableDevices`, and the NVIDIA vGPU Manager
> on the host. At Prepare time the driver creates the concrete mediated
> device (`mdev` framework) or programs the vGPU type of an SR-IOV VF
> (`vdev` framework, VFs pre-enabled by the administrator), and exposes the
> result via CDI and Device Metadata (`DeviceMetadata` gate) for VM
> consumers such as KubeVirt.

vGPU partitions are abstract devices: one entry per (profile, slot) exists in
the ResourceSlice before any concrete vGPU device has been created. Selection
is done via shared counters on the parent GPU's CounterSet, exactly as for
dynamic MIG. The device name never contains a live mdev UUID or VF PCI
address; those are produced at Prepare time.

```yaml
- attributes:
    profile:
      string: NVIDIA L40S-12Q       # full vGPU type name
    profileSlug:
      string: 12q                   # short, stable ID used in the device name
    productName:
      string: NVIDIA L40S           # inherited from the parent GPU
    resource.kubernetes.io/pciBusID:
      string: 0000:65:00.0          # PCI bus address of the parent GPU
    resource.kubernetes.io/pcieRoot:
      string: pci0000:64            # inherited from the parent GPU
    slot:
      int: 2                        # slot index within this profile family (0..maxInstances-1)
    sriovCapable:
      bool: true                    # whether the parent PCI function is SR-IOV capable
    type:
      string: vgpu                  # device kind
    typeID:
      int: 1177                     # numeric vGPU type ID reported by NVML
    uuid:
      string: GPU-2fa81118-5a5f-aa66-7660-471eed407181  # parent GPU UUID
    vgpuFramework:
      string: mdev                  # host management framework: mdev or vdev
  consumesCounters:
  - counterSet: gpu-0-counter-set
    compatibilityGroups:
    - vgpu-12q                      # only when the DRADeviceCompatibilityGroups gate is on
    counters:
      framebuffer:
        value: 12Gi                 # framebuffer budget consumed from the parent GPU
                                  # (no instance counter: maxInstances slot devices are the slot bound)
  name: vgpu-gpu-0-12q-2
```

When `VGPUSupport` is enabled, full-GPU devices on a GPU with advertised vGPU
partitions consume the entire per-GPU CounterSet and (with the
`DRADeviceCompatibilityGroups` gate) carry the compatibility group
`gpu-full`, so a full-GPU claim can never be co-scheduled with vGPU
partitions on the same physical GPU. vGPU partitions of different profile
families carry disjoint `vgpu-<slug>` groups and cannot be co-scheduled
either.

## NUMA locality

The GPU kubelet plugin publishes the standard
`resource.kubernetes.io/numaNode` attribute for full GPUs, MIG devices, and
VFIO devices when the PCI NUMA node is available and non-negative.

By default, the attribute uses the scalar `int` form shown in the examples.
When you enable both the driver and Kubernetes `DRAListTypeAttributes` feature
gates, the ResourceSlice serialization changes to a one-element `ints` list:

```yaml
resource.kubernetes.io/numaNode:
  ints:
  - 0
```

This representation change matters when inspecting or parsing ResourceSlices,
but it does not change the attribute name that you specify in ResourceClaims,
like the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: resource.k8s.io/v1
kind: ResourceClaimTemplate
metadata:
  name: same-numa-gpus
spec:
  spec:
    devices:
      requests:
      - name: gpus
        exactly:
          deviceClassName: gpu.nvidia.com
          allocationMode: ExactCount
          count: 2
      constraints:
      - requests:
        - gpus
        matchAttribute: resource.kubernetes.io/numaNode
```

This constraint requires all devices selected for `gpus` to have the same
published NUMA value. It uses the same
`resource.kubernetes.io/numaNode` spelling for both the scalar `int` and
one-element `ints` representations.

### Troubleshooting: verify the NUMA value

List each GPU device with its node, PCI bus ID, and published NUMA value:

```bash
kubectl get resourceslices -o json | jq -r '
  (
    ["NODE", "DEVICE", "PCI_BUS_ID", "PUBLISHED_NUMA"],
    (
      .items[]
      | select(.spec.driver == "gpu.nvidia.com")
      | .spec.nodeName as $node
      | .spec.devices[]
      | .basic.attributes as $attrs
      | select($attrs["resource.kubernetes.io/pciBusID"] != null)
      | ($attrs["resource.kubernetes.io/numaNode"] // {}) as $numa
      | [
          $node,
          .name,
          $attrs["resource.kubernetes.io/pciBusID"].string,
          (
            if $numa.int != null then ($numa.int | tostring)
            elif $numa.ints != null then ($numa.ints | join(","))
            else "omitted"
            end
          )
        ]
    )
  )
  | @tsv'
```

For one row, use its `NODE` and `PCI_BUS_ID` values to read the host PCI
device's NUMA node:

```bash
NODE=<node-from-output>
BDF=<pci-bus-id-from-output>

kubectl debug "node/${NODE}" -it --image=ubuntu -- chroot /host \
  cat "/sys/bus/pci/devices/${BDF}/numa_node"
```

A non-negative host value must match `PUBLISHED_NUMA`. MIG devices report the
locality of their parent GPU and therefore use the parent's PCI bus ID. If the
host reports `-1`, the PCI device has no NUMA locality, or discovery is
otherwise unavailable, the GPU kubelet plugin omits
`resource.kubernetes.io/numaNode`; it does not publish `-1`.

## Fabric Manager partition attributes

When you enable `FabricManagerPartitioning`, the GPU kubelet plugin publishes
Fabric Manager attributes on full-GPU and VFIO devices when Fabric Manager
reports the corresponding data.
MIG devices do not receive these attributes.

| Attribute | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `gpuModuleID` | Physical GPU module identifier reported by NVML and used by Fabric Manager. |
| `partitionN` | Fabric Manager partition ID for the N-GPU partition that contains this GPU; for example, `partition2` identifies a reported two-GPU partition. |

The GPU kubelet plugin emits each `partitionN` attribute only when Fabric
Manager reports a partition of that size containing the GPU.
The attribute name uses the exact spelling `gpuModuleID`, including the
uppercase `ID`.

To request two full GPUs or VFIO GPUs from the same two-GPU Fabric Manager
partition, set the request count to `2` and add this constraint to the same
claim:

```yaml
constraints:
- requests:
  - gpus
  matchAttribute: gpu.nvidia.com/partition2
```

You can also use a CEL selector for a known node-local module identifier:

```text
device.attributes['gpu.nvidia.com'].gpuModuleID == 1
```

Partition IDs and module IDs describe the local Fabric Manager topology, so use
a `matchAttribute` constraint when you need portable co-placement instead of
selecting a hardcoded partition ID.
The allocated physical-GPU set must exactly match the reported partition when
the driver prepares the claim.
Refer to
[Fabric Manager partitioning](../guides/gpu-allocation/fabric-manager-partitioning.md)
for prerequisites and complete full-GPU and VFIO examples.

## Attribute naming: bare keys vs CEL domain

The same attribute has two naming forms. In the serialized `ResourceSlice`,
driver attributes appear as **bare keys** (`type`, `productName`, and so on)
because their domain is implied by the driver name. In a **CEL selector**, you
address them through that domain, `device.attributes['gpu.nvidia.com'].type`. The
standardized PCI attributes are the exception: they are stored fully qualified as
`resource.kubernetes.io/pciBusID`, `resource.kubernetes.io/pcieRoot`, and
`resource.kubernetes.io/numaNode`.

In selectors, attributes are read with
`device.attributes['gpu.nvidia.com'].<name>` and capacity with
`device.capacity['gpu.nvidia.com'].<name>`. For example, to match a GPU with more
than 40 GiB of memory:

```
device.capacity['gpu.nvidia.com'].memory.isGreaterThan(quantity("40Gi"))
```

For full selector examples, see
[Request full GPUs](../guides/gpu-allocation/allocating-gpus.md#select-a-gpu-by-product-name).
CEL-based device selection is a standard Kubernetes DRA feature; see the
[Kubernetes DRA documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/dynamic-resource-allocation/)
for the complete selector syntax.
